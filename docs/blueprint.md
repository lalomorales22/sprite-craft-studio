# **App Name**: SpriteCraft Studio

## Core Features:

- Sprite Sheet Generation: Generate 8-bit sprite sheets from user-uploaded images and descriptions using the OpenAI image generation model. The tool decides how to create the 8bit character based on the image provided by the user
- Sprite Sheet Editor: Provide an editor for users to remove backgrounds, zoom, and touch up sprite sheets. Allow saving individual sprite images.
- Character Assembly and World Integration: Enable users to assemble a character from individual sprite images (walking left/right, running, jumping, crouching, standing, sitting), and then add the character to a shared game world environment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep teal (#008080) to evoke a sense of nostalgia and creativity.
- Secondary color: A muted gray (#808080) for backgrounds and UI elements to provide a clean canvas.
- Accent: A bright, pixelated pink (#FF69B4) for interactive elements and highlights.
- A split-screen layout for the editor, with sprite sheet generation on the left and sprite customization on the right.
- Pixel-art style icons for editing tools and character actions, to maintain the 8-bit theme.
- Subtle animations for character movements and UI transitions, creating a fluid and engaging experience.
